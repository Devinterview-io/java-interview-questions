Why is Java called the “Platform Independent Programming Language”?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p>A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a process virtual machine that can execute Java bytecode. Each Java source file is compiled into a bytecode file, which is executed by the JVM. Java was designed to allow application programs to be built that could be run on any platform, without having to be rewritten or recompiled by the programmer for each separate platform. A Java virtual machine makes this possible, because it is aware of the specific instruction lengths and other particularities of the underlying hardware platform.</p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://github.com/snowdream/115-Java-Interview-Questions-and-Answers" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What is JVM?

Furthermore, a Java application requires a main method with a specific signature, in order to start its execution. Java applets don’t need such a method to start their execution.

What differences exist between HashMap and Hashtable?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p>There are several differences between <code>HashMap</code> and <code>Hashtable</code> in Java:</p><ol><li><p><code>Hashtable</code> is synchronized, whereas <code>HashMap</code> is not. This makes <code>HashMap</code> better for non-threaded applications, as unsynchronized Objects typically perform better than synchronized ones.</p></li><li><p><code>Hashtable</code> does not allow <code>null</code> keys or values.  <code>HashMap</code> allows one <code>null</code> key and any number of <code>null</code> values.</p></li><li><p>One of HashMap's subclasses is <code>LinkedHashMap</code>, so in the event that you'd want predictable iteration order (which is insertion order by default), you could easily swap out the <code>HashMap</code> for a <code>LinkedHashMap</code>.  This wouldn't be as easy if you were using <code>Hashtable</code>.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40471/differences-between-hashmap-and-hashtable" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What differences exist between HashMap and Hashtable?

Then, the Web server reads the request and using the JSP compiler, the Web server converts the JSP page into a servlet class. Notice that the JSP file is compiled only on the first request of the page, or if the JSP file has changed.The generated servlet class is invoked, in order to handle the browser’s request. Once the execution of the request is over, the servlet sends a response back to the client.
